#### Usage
Change `setres.ps1` to your desired resolution, then run the script by double clicking or right click + run.

Personally use it to quickly change res when I play CSGO so my screen doesn't lag when I tab out. Enjoy!

#### Troubleshooting

Can't run the script? Open Powershell as admin and type this

`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
